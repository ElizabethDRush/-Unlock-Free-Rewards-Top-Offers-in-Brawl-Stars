1. Daily Freebies in the Shop
Every day, Brawl Stars offers free items in the in-game shop. These can include coins, power points, or even exclusive pins. To claim these, make it a habit to check the shop daily. The rewards might seem small at first, but they add up over time and can give you a significant edge.

2. Brawl Pass Free Track
The Brawl Pass has two tracks: free and premium. While the premium version requires gems, the free track still offers a variety of rewards, including:

By completing daily and seasonal quests, you can quickly progress through the Brawl Pass and claim these rewards.

Focusing on improving your skills and gaining trophies is a great way to steadily increase your collection.

At the end of every season, players receive rewards based on their Trophy Road progress. Higher trophies mean better rewards, so aim to push your Brawlers to their maximum potential during each season.
